# Module 5: Model Registry and Versioning

**AI Content Generation Prompt:**
Create comprehensive guide to model management:

1. **Model Versioning Strategies** - Semantic versioning for models, version naming conventions, model metadata, versioning best practices, comparison with software versioning

2. **Model Registry Systems** - MLflow Model Registry, architecture and concepts, model stages (staging, production, archived), stage transitions, approval workflows, complete implementation

3. **Alternative Registry Solutions** - W&B Model Registry, Neptune Model Registry, custom registry implementation, comparison of solutions, migration strategies

4. **Model Metadata Management** - Training metadata (hyperparameters, metrics), dataset versions, feature dependencies, model lineage, custom metadata, querying capabilities

5. **Model Packaging** - Model serialization formats (pickle, ONNX, TorchScript, SavedModel), packaging standards, dependency management, containerization

6. **Model Lineage Tracking** - Parent-child model relationships, experiment to model tracking, data lineage connection, full provenance graph, visualization

7. **Model Promotion and Deployment** - Promotion workflows, automated vs manual approval, deployment gates, rollback procedures, multi-environment management

8. **Governance and Compliance** - Model inventory, compliance requirements, model documentation, audit trails, access control, retention policies

9. **Model Comparison** - Comparing model versions, A/B test results, champion/challenger models, decision frameworks, automated selection

10. **Integration with CI/CD** - Automated model registration, triggered deployments, validation gates, notification systems, complete pipeline example

11. **Multi-Model Management** - Managing model ensembles, shadow models, canary models, model dependencies, microservice architectures

12. **Best Practices** - Naming conventions, documentation requirements, retirement strategies, storage optimization, team workflows

Include: Architecture diagrams, MLflow Registry code, API examples, governance templates, 15 exercises

Target: 1300-1600 lines with complete registry implementation.
