# Module 9: CI/CD for Machine Learning

**AI Content Generation Prompt:**
Create comprehensive CI/CD guide for ML:

1. **CI/CD Fundamentals for ML** - Differences from software CI/CD, challenges in ML pipelines, continuous training, continuous deployment, MLOps pipeline architecture

2. **Version Control for ML** - Git workflows, branching strategies, code review, Git LFS, DVC integration, model versioning in Git

3. **Automated Testing for ML** - Data validation tests, model tests, integration tests, performance tests, behavioral tests, test pyramid for ML

4. **Test-Driven Development for ML** - TDD principles adapted for ML, writing tests first, test coverage, mutation testing

5. **Pre-Training Validation** - Data quality checks, schema validation, distribution checks, feature validation, automated data profiling

6. **Model Validation Gates** - Accuracy thresholds, fairness metrics, performance benchmarks, bias detection, automated validation

7. **GitHub Actions for ML** - Workflow configuration, matrix strategies, caching, artifacts, secrets management, self-hosted runners, complete examples

8. **Jenkins for ML** - Pipeline as code, Jenkinsfile, distributed builds, plugin ecosystem, integration with MLflow

9. **GitLab CI for ML** - .gitlab-ci.yml, runners, caching, environments, Auto DevOps, complete pipeline

10. **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform for ML infrastructure, Ansible, CloudFormation, environment management, reproducible infrastructure

11. **Container Orchestration in CI/CD** - Building Docker images in CI, registry integration, vulnerability scanning, image optimization

12. **Continuous Training** - Scheduled retraining, data-triggered training, performance-triggered training, automated hyperparameter tuning, pipeline orchestration

13. **Model Deployment Automation** - Automated promotion, deployment gates, rollback automation, multi-environment deployment, blue-green in CI/CD

14. **Integration Testing in Production** - Smoke tests, canary analysis, shadow mode testing, A/B test automation

15. **Monitoring Integration** - Alerting from CI/CD, metric collection, dashboard updates, notification systems

16. **ML Pipeline Orchestration** - Airflow DAGs, Prefect flows, Kubeflow Pipelines, Argo Workflows, comparison and selection

17. **Best Practices** - Pipeline optimization, caching strategies, parallel execution, failure handling, notification management

18. **Complete Pipeline Examples** - End-to-end training pipeline, deployment pipeline, retraining pipeline, complete GitOps workflow

Include: YAML configs, Jenkinsfiles, Terraform scripts, complete pipelines, 20+ exercises, architecture diagrams

Target: 1600-2000 lines with production CI/CD pipelines.
