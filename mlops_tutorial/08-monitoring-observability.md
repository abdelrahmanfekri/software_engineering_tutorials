# Module 8: Monitoring and Observability

**AI Content Generation Prompt:**
Create complete guide to ML monitoring:

1. **Monitoring Fundamentals** - Why monitor ML systems, what to monitor (model, data, system), monitoring levels, alerting principles, SLIs/SLOs/SLAs

2. **Performance Metrics** - Latency (p50, p95, p99), throughput, error rates, resource utilization (CPU, GPU, memory), saturation, custom metrics

3. **Model Performance Monitoring** - Accuracy tracking in production, precision/recall monitoring, business metrics, ground truth collection, labeling strategies

4. **Data Drift Detection** - Statistical tests (KS test, chi-square), population stability index, distance metrics, Evidently AI implementation, drift visualization

5. **Concept Drift** - Definition and types, detection methods, retraining triggers, adaptive models, handling concept drift

6. **Feature Drift** - Individual feature monitoring, feature importance drift, correlation changes, distribution shifts

7. **Prediction Drift** - Output distribution monitoring, confidence scores, outlier detection, anomaly scores

8. **Logging Best Practices** - Structured logging, log levels, sampling, PII handling, centralized logging (ELK, Loki), log analysis

9. **Tracing** - Distributed tracing, OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, request flow visualization, performance bottleneck identification

10. **Prometheus and Grafana** - Metrics collection, PromQL, exporters, dashboard creation, alerting rules, complete setup

11. **Alerting Systems** - Alert design, alert fatigue prevention, severity levels, escalation policies, PagerDuty/Opsgenie integration

12. **Model Explainability Monitoring** - SHAP values tracking, feature importance drift, explanation drift, trust scores

13. **Business Metrics** - ROI tracking, user engagement, conversion rates, revenue impact, A/B test results

14. **Automated Response** - Auto-scaling triggers, automatic rollback, circuit breakers, self-healing systems

15. **Incident Management** - Incident response playbooks, post-mortems, root cause analysis, continuous improvement

16. **Compliance and Audit** - Audit logging, compliance monitoring, model governance, regulatory requirements

Include: Monitoring dashboards, Prometheus configs, Grafana dashboards, alerting rules, drift detection code, 20 exercises

Target: 1500-1800 lines with complete monitoring stack.
