# Module 3: Experiment Tracking and Management

**AI Content Generation Prompt:**
Create comprehensive guide to ML experiment tracking:

1. **Experiment Tracking Fundamentals** - Why track experiments, what to track (hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts, code versions), experiment organization, reproducibility requirements

2. **MLflow Complete Guide** - MLflow Tracking API, experiments and runs, logging parameters/metrics/artifacts, model logging, MLflow UI, backend stores, artifact stores, complete implementation with examples

3. **Weights & Biases (W&B)** - W&B setup and initialization, experiment logging, interactive dashboards, hyperparameter sweeps, artifact versioning, collaboration features, W&B Reports, full implementation

4. **TensorBoard** - TensorBoard basics, logging scalars/images/histograms, embedding visualization, profiler, integration with PyTorch/TensorFlow, custom plugins

5. **Hyperparameter Optimization** - Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization (Optuna, Hyperopt), integrated with tracking, parallel experiments, best practices

6. **Experiment Organization** - Naming conventions, tagging strategies, experiment groups, archiving, searching experiments, comparison tools

7. **Reproducibility** - Environment management (conda, pip, Docker), random seed control, data versioning integration, code versioning, complete reproducibility checklist

8. **Integration and Automation** - CI/CD integration, automated experiment running, programmatic querying, alerting on metrics, integration with notebooks

9. **Advanced Features** - Distributed experiments, meta-learning tracking, multi-run analysis, experiment comparison, visualization techniques

10. **Best Practices** - What to log, when to log, storage optimization, team collaboration, experiment management at scale

Include: Setup guides, code examples for all platforms, dashboard screenshots, 15 exercises, comparison matrix

Target: 1300-1600 lines with extensive code.
