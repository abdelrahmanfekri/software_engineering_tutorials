# Module 4: Model Development Best Practices

**AI Content Generation Prompt:**
Create guide to professional ML code development:

1. **Code Organization** - Project structure templates, separation of concerns, modular design, package structure, configuration files, utilities organization

2. **Configuration Management** - Hydra for configs, YAML/JSON configs, environment variables, config validation, hierarchical configs, overrides, complete examples

3. **Testing ML Code** - Unit tests for preprocessing, model tests, data validation tests, integration tests, pytest framework, fixtures, mocking, test coverage

4. **Model Debugging** - Debugging techniques for ML, gradient checking, activation inspection, weight visualization, NaN/Inf handling, debugging distributed training

5. **Code Quality** - Linting (pylint, flake8, black), type hints, docstrings, code reviews, pre-commit hooks, static analysis

6. **Documentation** - README standards, API documentation, model cards, data sheets, architecture diagrams, Sphinx/MkDocs

7. **Dependency Management** - requirements.txt vs setup.py, Poetry, version pinning, virtual environments, Docker for reproducibility

8. **Notebook Management** - Notebook best practices, converting to scripts, parameterized notebooks (papermill), version control for notebooks, nbdev

9. **Error Handling** - Exception handling, logging best practices, error recovery, graceful degradation

10. **Performance Optimization** - Profiling code, optimization techniques, memory management, efficient data loading, multi-processing

Include: Code templates, complete examples, CI/CD integration, 15-20 exercises, checklist

Target: 1200-1500 lines with production-ready code patterns.
