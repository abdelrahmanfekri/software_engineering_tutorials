# Angular Example Project

A practical example project demonstrating the concepts from the Angular tutorial.

## Project Overview

This is a simple user management application that covers:
- Component creation and communication
- Services and dependency injection
- Routing and navigation
- Forms (template and reactive)
- HTTP requests and error handling
- Basic state management
- Testing

## Features

- User list display
- Add new users
- Edit existing users
- Delete users
- Search and filter
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this project
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `ng serve`
4. Open browser to `http://localhost:4200`

## Key Learning Points

### 1. Component Communication
- Parent-child communication with @Input/@Output
- Service-based communication between unrelated components

### 2. Service Patterns
- Singleton services with `providedIn: 'root'`
- HTTP service with error handling
- State management with BehaviorSubject

### 3. Form Handling
- Template-driven forms for simple cases
- Reactive forms for complex validation
- Custom validators

### 4. Routing
- Route configuration with parameters
- Route guards for authentication
- Lazy loading for performance

### 5. Testing
- Component testing with TestBed
- Service testing with HTTP mocking
- E2E testing with Protractor

## Next Steps

After completing this example:
1. Add more features (pagination, sorting, etc.)
2. Implement real backend integration
3. Add authentication and authorization
4. Implement advanced state management with NgRx
5. Add unit and integration tests
6. Optimize for production deployment

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Component not updating
- Check change detection strategy
- Verify data binding syntax
- Ensure service is properly injected

### Issue: Form validation not working
- Check form control names
- Verify validators are properly applied
- Ensure form is properly initialized

### Issue: Routing not working
- Check route configuration
- Verify router outlet placement
- Check for route guard conflicts

## Performance Tips

1. Use OnPush change detection for read-only components
2. Implement trackBy functions for large lists
3. Lazy load feature modules
4. Use pure pipes for data transformations
5. Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets

## Security Considerations

1. Sanitize all user inputs
2. Implement proper authentication
3. Use HTTPS in production
4. Validate all form data
5. Implement CSRF protection
