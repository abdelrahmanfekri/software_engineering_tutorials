# Module 1: Classical Computer Vision Foundations

**AI Content Generation Prompt:**
Create a comprehensive tutorial on classical computer vision techniques covering:

1. **Image Representation and Color Spaces**

   - Image data structures in Python/OpenCV
   - Code examples for color space transformations

2. **Image Preprocessing and Enhancement**
   - Histogram equalization and CLAHE
   - Image normalization techniques
   - Noise reduction (Gaussian blur, median filter, bilateral filter)
   - Image sharpening
   - Morphological operations (erosion, dilation, opening, closing)
   - Python implementations with OpenCV

3. **Edge Detection Algorithms**
   - Gradient-based methods (Sobel, Prewitt, Scharr)
   - Canny edge detector (theory and implementation)
   - Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)
   - Zero-crossing detection
   - Comparative analysis of edge detectors
   - Full code implementations and visualizations

4. **Classical Feature Extraction**
   - Harris corner detector
   - SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) - theory and usage
   - SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)
   - ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

   - Feature matching techniques
   - Practical examples for each method

5. **Geometric Transformations**
   - Affine transformations (translation, rotation, scaling, shearing)
   - Perspective transformations
   - Homography estimation
   - Image warping and rectification
