# Computer Vision Tutorial

## Description
A comprehensive tutorial series covering computer vision from classical techniques to state-of-the-art deep learning models. This tutorial prepares you for real-world computer vision applications including object detection, segmentation, image generation, 3D vision, and production deployment.

## What You'll Learn
- Classical computer vision (edge detection, feature extraction, transformations)
- Convolutional Neural Networks and modern architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, ViT)
- Object detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, DETR)
- Image segmentation (U-Net, Mask R-CNN, semantic/instance/panoptic)
- Generative models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion models)
- 3D vision and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
- Video understanding and temporal modeling
- Production deployment and optimization
- Vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP, multimodal systems)
