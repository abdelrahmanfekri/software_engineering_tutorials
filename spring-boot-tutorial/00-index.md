### Spring Boot 3.5+ with Java 21 â€” Overview and Plan

This tutorial is a pragmatic, code-first path to learn Spring Boot 3.5+ on Java 21. You will build a production-style REST service step by step and learn modern Spring capabilities along the way.

### Learning objectives
- Understand Boot's auto-configuration, DI, and configuration management
- Build robust REST APIs with validation, error handling, and documentation
- Persist data with Spring Data JPA and manage schema with Flyway
- Secure APIs with Spring Security and JWT; apply method security
- Test with JUnit 5, Testcontainers, and slice tests
- Add observability with Actuator, metrics, logs, and tracing
- Use messaging and events (Spring events, Kafka)
- Explore reactive programming with WebFlux
- Optimize performance with Java 21 virtual threads and structured concurrency
- Build native images with GraalVM; containerize and deploy
- Apply best practices; complete a hands-on capstone

### What you will build
- Bookstore API: CRUD for books and authors, JWT-secured endpoints, Postgres+Flyway, integration tests with Testcontainers, metrics and tracing, Docker build.

### Suggested schedule (self-paced)
- Day 1: Setup, project creation, core concepts
- Day 2: REST, validation, error handling
- Day 3: Data JPA + Flyway; testing basics
- Day 4: Security + JWT
- Day 5: Observability; messaging
- Day 6: WebFlux; performance with virtual threads
- Day 7: Native images, Docker, deploy; best practices
- Day 8+: Capstone and labs

### Conventions used
- Build: Gradle Kotlin DSL (Maven equivalents shown as needed)
- Config files: `application.yml`
- Java 21 `record` and modern features where helpful
