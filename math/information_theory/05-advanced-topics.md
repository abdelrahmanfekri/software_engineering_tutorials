## Maximum Entropy Principle

### Principle Statement
The maximum entropy principle states that, given constraints, the probability distribution that best represents our knowledge is the one with maximum entropy.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
Given constraints E[f_i(X)] = c_i for i = 1, ..., m, choose p(x) to maximize:

H(X) = -Σ p(x) log p(x)

Subject to:
- Σ p(x) = 1 (normalization)
- Σ p(x) f_i(x) = c_i (constraints)

### Solution: Exponential Family
The solution has the form:

p(x) = (1/Z) exp(Σ λ_i f_i(x))

Where:
- Z is the partition function
- λ_i are Lagrange multipliers

### Examples

**Example 1**: Given mean and variance constraints
- Constraints: E[X] = μ, E[X²] = σ² + μ²
- Solution: Gaussian distribution N(μ, σ²)

**Example 2**: Given mean constraint only
- Constraint: E[X] = μ
- Solution: Exponential distribution

**Example 3**: Given range constraint
- Constraint: X ∈ [a, b]
- Solution: Uniform distribution U(a, b)

### Applications

**Statistical Mechanics**:
- Boltzmann distribution maximizes entropy given energy constraint
- Temperature emerges as Lagrange multiplier

**Machine Learning**:
- Maximum entropy models (logistic regression)
- Regularization through entropy constraints
- Bayesian inference with maximum entropy priors

## Information Geometry

### Fisher Information Matrix
For a parametric family p(x|θ), the Fisher information matrix is:

I(θ) = E[∇θ log p(x|θ) ∇θ log p(x|θ)ᵀ]

**Properties**:
- Positive semidefinite
- Measures curvature of log-likelihood
- Related to Cramér-Rao bound

### Fisher-Rao Metric
The Fisher information matrix defines a Riemannian metric on parameter space:

ds² = dθᵀ I(θ) dθ

**Geometric Interpretation**:
- Distance between distributions
- Natural gradient direction
- Curvature of parameter space

### Natural Gradient
Instead of Euclidean gradient, use natural gradient:

∇̃f(θ) = I(θ)⁻¹ ∇f(θ)

**Advantages**:
- Invariant to parameterization
- Faster convergence
- Better optimization properties

### Applications

**Neural Networks**:
- Natural gradient descent
- Fisher information for regularization
- Second-order optimization methods

**Bayesian Inference**:
- Information geometry of posterior
- Variational inference on manifolds
- Approximate inference methods

## Quantum Information Theory

### Quantum Entropy (von Neumann Entropy)
For a quantum state ρ, the von Neumann entropy is:

S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ)

**Properties**:
- S(ρ) ≥ 0
- S(ρ) = 0 if and only if ρ is pure
- S(ρ) ≤ log d for d-dimensional system

### Quantum Mutual Information
For bipartite quantum state ρ_AB:

I(A;B) = S(ρ_A) + S(ρ_B) - S(ρ_AB)

Where ρ_A = Tr_B(ρ_AB) is the reduced state.

### Quantum Channel Capacity
The capacity of a quantum channel N is:

C(N) = max I(A;B)

Where the maximum is over all input states ρ_A.

### Applications

**Quantum Computing**:
- Quantum error correction
- Quantum communication
- Quantum cryptography

**Quantum Machine Learning**:
- Quantum feature maps
- Quantum neural networks
- Quantum optimization

## Information-Theoretic Security

### Perfect Secrecy
A cryptosystem has perfect secrecy if:

I(M; C) = 0

Where M is the message and C is the ciphertext.

**Shannon's Theorem**: Perfect secrecy requires |K| ≥ |M| where K is the key space.

### Differential Privacy
A mechanism M is ε-differentially private if:

log(P[M(D) ∈ S] / P[M(D') ∈ S]) ≤ ε

For all neighboring datasets D, D' and all sets S.

**Information-Theoretic Interpretation**:
- Bounds mutual information between data and output
- Provides privacy guarantees
- Enables privacy-preserving machine learning

### Secure Multi-Party Computation
Use information theory to analyze secure computation protocols:

**Privacy**: Parties learn only what's necessary
**Correctness**: Output is computed correctly
**Efficiency**: Minimal communication and computation

## Advanced Information Measures

### Conditional Mutual Information
For three random variables X, Y, Z:

I(X; Y | Z) = H(X | Z) - H(X | Y, Z)

**Properties**:
- I(X; Y | Z) ≥ 0
- I(X; Y | Z) = 0 if and only if X ⊥ Y | Z
- Chain rule: I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z | Y)

### Interaction Information
For three variables:

I(X; Y; Z) = I(X; Y) - I(X; Y | Z)

**Interpretation**:
- Positive: Synergistic interaction
- Negative: Redundant interaction
- Zero: No interaction

### Total Correlation
For n variables X₁, ..., Xₙ:

TC(X₁, ..., Xₙ) = Σ H(X_i) - H(X₁, ..., Xₙ)

**Properties**:
- TC ≥ 0
- TC = 0 if and only if variables are independent
- Measures total dependence

**Multiple Access Channel**:
- Multiple senders, single receiver

Where U is a universal Turing machine.

**Applications**:

## Practical Implementation

### Information-Theoretic Feature Selection
Advanced feature selection using information theory:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_regression
from sklearn.metrics import mutual_info_score

def conditional_mutual_info(X, Y, Z, bins=10):
    """Estimate conditional mutual information I(X; Y | Z)"""
    # Discretize variables
    X_disc = np.digitize(X, np.linspace(X.min(), X.max(), bins))
    Y_disc = np.digitize(Y, np.linspace(Y.min(), Y.max(), bins))
    Z_disc = np.digitize(Z, np.linspace(Z.min(), Z.max(), bins))
    
    # Calculate conditional MI
    mi_xy = mutual_info_score(X_disc, Y_disc)
    mi_xyz = 0
    
    for z_val in np.unique(Z_disc):
        mask = Z_disc == z_val
        if np.sum(mask) > 1:
            mi_xy_z = mutual_info_score(X_disc[mask], Y_disc[mask])
            mi_xyz += mi_xy_z * np.sum(mask) / len(Z_disc)
    
    return mi_xy - mi_xyz

def information_bottleneck(X, Y, beta=0.1, n_iter=100):
    """Simple information bottleneck implementation"""
    # Initialize representation
    Z = np.random.randn(len(X), 2)
    
    for _ in range(n_iter):
        # Update representation to maximize I(Z; Y) - β I(Z; X)
        # This is a simplified version - full implementation requires
        # variational methods or neural networks
        pass
    
    return Z
```

### Maximum Entropy Modeling
Implement maximum entropy models:

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.special import logsumexp

def max_entropy_model(features, constraints, n_samples=1000):
    """Fit maximum entropy model given constraints"""
    n_features = len(features[0])
    
    def neg_log_likelihood(params):
        # Calculate log-likelihood
        logits = np.dot(features, params)
        log_z = logsumexp(logits)
        log_likelihood = np.sum(logits) - n_samples * log_z
        
        # Add constraint penalties
        penalty = 0
        for i, constraint in enumerate(constraints):
            expected = np.mean(features[:, i])
            penalty += (expected - constraint) ** 2
        
        return -(log_likelihood - penalty)
    
    # Optimize parameters
    result = minimize(neg_log_likelihood, np.zeros(n_features))
    return result.x
```

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1
Given constraints E[X] = 2 and E[X²] = 5, find the maximum entropy distribution.

**Solution**:
Using Lagrange multipliers:
L = -∫ p(x) log p(x) dx + λ₁(∫ x p(x) dx - 2) + λ₂(∫ x² p(x) dx - 5) + μ(∫ p(x) dx - 1)

Taking derivative with respect to p(x):
-1 - log p(x) + λ₁x + λ₂x² + μ = 0

Therefore: p(x) = exp(λ₁x + λ₂x² + μ - 1)

This is a Gaussian distribution. Given the constraints:
- μ = 2 (mean)
- σ² = 5 - 2² = 1 (variance)

So p(x) = (1/√(2π)) exp(-(x-2)²/2)

### Problem 2
For a quantum state ρ = (1/2)|0⟩⟨0| + (1/2)|1⟩⟨1|, calculate the von Neumann entropy.

**Solution**:
S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ)

Since ρ is diagonal: ρ = diag(1/2, 1/2)

S(ρ) = -(1/2) log(1/2) - (1/2) log(1/2) = -(-1/2) - (-1/2) = 1

### Problem 3
In a differential privacy mechanism, if ε = 1 and the mechanism outputs are {0, 1, 2}, what's the maximum ratio of probabilities for neighboring datasets?

**Solution**:
For ε-differential privacy: P[M(D) ∈ S] / P[M(D') ∈ S] ≤ e^ε

Maximum ratio = e^1 = e ≈ 2.718
