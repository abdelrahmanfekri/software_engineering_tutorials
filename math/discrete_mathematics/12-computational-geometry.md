## 1. Convex Hulls

### Definition
The **convex hull** of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points.

### Properties
- **Convexity**: Any line segment between two points in the hull lies entirely within the hull
- **Minimality**: The hull is the smallest convex set containing all points
- **Uniqueness**: The convex hull is unique for any given set of points

### Graham Scan Algorithm
```
GRAHAM-SCAN(P):
    p0 = point with minimum y-coordinate (and minimum x-coordinate if tied)
    sort remaining points by polar angle with respect to p0
    stack = [p0, p1, p2]
    for i = 3 to n-1:
        while stack.size() > 1 and CCW(stack[stack.size()-2], stack[stack.size()-1], p[i]) <= 0:
            stack.pop()
        stack.push(p[i])
    return stack

CCW(p1, p2, p3):
    return (p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping)
```
JARVIS-MARCH(P):
    hull = []
    start = point with minimum x-coordinate
    current = start
    do:
        hull.append(current)
        next = P[0]
        for i = 1 to n-1:
            if next == current or CCW(current, next, P[i]) < 0:
                next = P[i]
        current = next
    while current != start
    return hull
```

**Time Complexity**: O(nh) where h is the number of hull points
**Space Complexity**: O(h)

### Applications

## 2. Voronoi Diagrams

### Definition
A **Voronoi diagram** partitions the plane into regions based on distance to a set of points (sites).

### Properties
- **Voronoi cell**: Region of points closer to one site than any other
- **Voronoi edge**: Boundary between two Voronoi cells
- **Voronoi vertex**: Point where three or more Voronoi cells meet

### Construction Algorithm
```
VORONOI-DIAGRAM(S):
    if |S| <= 3:
        return trivial case
    divide S into left and right halves
    left_diagram = VORONOI-DIAGRAM(left_half)
    right_diagram = VORONOI-DIAGRAM(right_half)
    return MERGE(left_diagram, right_diagram)
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### Applications

- **Facility location**: Optimal placement of facilities
- **Mesh generation**: Computational mesh creation
- **Biology**: Cell division, crystal growth

## 3. Delaunay Triangulation

### Definition
A **Delaunay triangulation** is a triangulation of a set of points such that no point lies inside the circumcircle of any triangle.

### Properties
- **Empty circle property**: No point lies inside the circumcircle of any triangle
- **Max-min angle property**: Maximizes the minimum angle of all triangles
- **Dual of Voronoi diagram**: The Delaunay triangulation is the dual of the Voronoi diagram

### Incremental Algorithm
```
DELAUNAY-TRIANGULATION(P):
    triangulation = supertriangle containing all points
    for each point p in P:
        find all triangles whose circumcircle contains p
        remove these triangles
        create new triangles with p and edges of the cavity
    remove triangles containing supertriangle vertices
    return triangulation
```

**Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) worst case, O(n log n) expected
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### Applications
- **Mesh generation**: Finite element analysis
- **Computer graphics**: Surface reconstruction
- **Geographic information systems**: Terrain modeling
- **Robotics**: Path planning

## 4. Line Segment Intersection

### Problem
Given n line segments, find all pairs that intersect.

### Sweep Line Algorithm
```
LINE-SEGMENT-INTERSECTION(S):
    events = []
    for each segment s in S:
        events.append((s.start, 'start', s))
        events.append((s.end, 'end', s))
    sort events by x-coordinate
    active_segments = set()
    intersections = []
    for each event in events:
        if event.type == 'start':
            for each active_segment in active_segments:
                if segments_intersect(event.segment, active_segment):
                    intersections.append((event.segment, active_segment))
            active_segments.add(event.segment)
        else:
            active_segments.remove(event.segment)
    return intersections
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n + k) where k is the number of intersections
**Space Complexity**: O(n + k)

## 5. Closest Pair Problems

### Problem

### Divide and Conquer Algorithm
```
CLOSEST-PAIR(P):
    if |P| <= 3:
        return brute force solution
    sort P by x-coordinate
    mid = |P| / 2
    left = P[0:mid]
    right = P[mid:]
    left_min = CLOSEST-PAIR(left)
    right_min = CLOSEST-PAIR(right)
    delta = min(left_min, right_min)
    strip = points within delta of the dividing line
    strip_min = closest pair in strip
    return min(delta, strip_min)
```
