## 1. Stirling Numbers

### Stirling Numbers of the First Kind
**Definition**: s(n, k) is the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k cycles.

**Recurrence relation**: s(n, k) = (n-1)s(n-1, k) + s(n-1, k-1)

**Base cases**: s(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0, s(n, n) = 1

**Example**: s(4, 2) = 11
- Permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4} with 2 cycles:
  - (1)(2, 3, 4), (1, 2)(3, 4), (1, 3)(2, 4), (1, 4)(2, 3)
  - (2)(1, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3)(4), (1, 2, 4)(3)
  - (3)(1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4)(2)
  - (4)(1, 2, 3), (1, 4, 3)(2)

### Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind
**Definition**: S(n, k) is the number of ways to partition n elements into k non-empty subsets.

**Recurrence relation**: S(n, k) = k·S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)

**Base cases**: S(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0, S(n, n) = 1

**Example**: S(4, 2) = 7
- Partitions of {1, 2, 3, 4} into 2 subsets:
  - {1}, {2, 3, 4}
  - {2}, {1, 3, 4}
  - {3}, {1, 2, 4}
  - {4}, {1, 2, 3}
  - {1, 2}, {3, 4}
  - {1, 3}, {2, 4}
  - {1, 4}, {2, 3}

### Properties
- **Orthogonality**: Σ s(n, k)S(k, m) = δ_{n,m}
- **Generating functions**: 
  - First kind: Σ s(n, k)x^k = x(x-1)...(x-n+1)
  - Second kind: Σ S(n, k)x^k = x^n

## 2. Bell Numbers

### Definition
The **Bell number** B_n is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements.

**Formula**: B_n = Σ S(n, k) for k = 0 to n

### Recurrence Relation
B_{n+1} = Σ C(n, k)B_k for k = 0 to n

### First Few Bell Numbers
B₀ = 1, B₁ = 1, B₂ = 2, B₃ = 5, B₄ = 15, B₅ = 52, B₆ = 203, ...

### Applications
- **Set partitions**: Counting equivalence relations
- **Database theory**: Partitioning data
- **Combinatorics**: Various counting problems
- **Probability**: Partitioning sample spaces

## 3. Partition Theory

### Integer Partitions
**Definition**: A partition of integer n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers, where order doesn't matter.

**Example**: Partitions of 4:
- 4
- 3 + 1
- 2 + 2
- 2 + 1 + 1
- 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

### Generating Functions
The generating function for partitions is:
P(x) = 1/((1-x)(1-x²)(1-x³)...) = 1/Π(1-x^k) for k ≥ 1

### Partition Function
p(n) = number of partitions of n

**Recurrence**: p(n) = Σ (-1)^{k+1}[p(n-k(3k-1)/2) + p(n-k(3k+1)/2)]

### Applications
- **Number theory**: Modular forms
- **Physics**: Statistical mechanics
- **Combinatorics**: Various counting problems
- **Algebra**: Representation theory

## 4. Ramsey Theory

### Ramsey's Theorem
**Statement**: For any positive integers r and s, there exists a number R(r, s) such that any complete graph with R(r, s) vertices, when edges are colored with two colors, contains either a complete subgraph of r vertices with all edges of the first color, or a complete subgraph of s vertices with all edges of the second color.

### Examples
- R(3, 3) = 6 (Party problem: In any group of 6 people, either 3 are mutual friends or 3 are mutual strangers)
- R(4, 4) = 18
- R(5, 5) is unknown (between 43 and 48)

### Applications
- **Graph theory**: Coloring problems
- **Number theory**: Diophantine equations
- **Computer science**: Algorithm analysis
- **Social networks**: Community detection

## 5. Design Theory

### Block Designs
**Definition**: A (v, k, λ)-design is a collection of k-element subsets (blocks) of a v-element set such that each pair of elements appears in exactly λ blocks.

### Balanced Incomplete Block Designs (BIBD)
A BIBD with parameters (v, b, r, k, λ) satisfies:
- v points, b blocks
- Each block contains k points
- Each point appears in r blocks
- Each pair of points appears in λ blocks

**Relations**: bk = vr, λ(v-1) = r(k-1)

### Examples
- **Fano plane**: (7, 7, 3, 3, 1)-design
- **Projective planes**: (n²+n+1, n²+n+1, n+1, n+1, 1)-design

### Applications
- **Experimental design**: Statistical experiments
- **Coding theory**: Error-correcting codes
- **Cryptography**: Secret sharing
- **Combinatorics**: Various counting problems

## 6. Coding Theory

### Error-Correcting Codes
**Definition**: An error-correcting code is a method of encoding data so that errors can be detected and corrected.

### Hamming Distance
The **Hamming distance** between two codewords is the number of positions where they differ.

### Hamming Codes
**Definition**: A Hamming code is a linear error-correcting code that can detect and correct single-bit errors.

**Parameters**: (2^m - 1, 2^m - m - 1, 3) for m ≥ 2

### Reed-Solomon Codes
**Definition**: Reed-Solomon codes are non-binary error-correcting codes that can correct multiple errors.

**Applications**: CDs, DVDs, QR codes, satellite communication

### Applications
- **Data storage**: Hard drives, CDs, DVDs
- **Communication**: Satellite, wireless, internet
- **Cryptography**: Secret sharing, authentication
- **Computer science**: Fault-tolerant systems
