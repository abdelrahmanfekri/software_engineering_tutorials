## Problem Solving Tutorials (Java) — 3+ Years SWE Track

Audience: Experienced engineers (3+ years) looking to master algorithmic problem solving in Java from fundamentals to advanced topics without needing external references.

What you’ll get:
- End-to-end curriculum with explanations, templates, and solved problems (easy/medium/hard)
- Practical Java 21 code you can reuse
- Checklists, patterns, and a study plan you can follow

How to use this track:
- Read modules in order. Skim if you already know the topic, but at least extract the templates and checklists.
- After each module, solve at least 3 practice problems (pick from the problem sets).
- Revisit the checklists before interviews/contests.

Suggested 8-week plan (approx. 8–10 hrs/week):
- Week 1: Mindset & Complexity, Core DS, Arrays & Two Pointers
- Week 2: Sliding Window, Binary Search, Stacks/Queues/Monotonic
- Week 3: Strings (KMP/Z/Hash), Linked Lists, Trees (BST)
- Week 4: Graphs (BFS/DFS/Topo, DSU), Shortest Paths, MST
- Week 5: Greedy, DP Basics
- Week 6: DP Advanced & Optimizations, Backtracking & Bitmasking
- Week 7: Number Theory & Combinatorics, Advanced Data Structures
- Week 8: Problem Sets (Easy/Medium/Hard), Checklists, Interview/Contest Prep

Practice rules:
- Implement from scratch; avoid copy-paste until you’ve solved it once.
- Always analyze complexity and potential optimizations.
- Track errors you make; add them to your personal checklist.

Environment
- Java 21, `javac` and `java` available. Use provided templates in `16-templates-and-snippets.md` to speed up coding.
