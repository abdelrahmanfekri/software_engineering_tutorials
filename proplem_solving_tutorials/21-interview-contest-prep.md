## 21 — Interview & Contest Prep

Week-before checklist
- Re-read `00-index.md` plan and extract weak areas
- Redo 3–5 mixed problems per day from easy/medium/hard
- Refresh templates in `16-templates-and-snippets.md`

Interview day playbook
- Clarify: restate problem, examples, constraints, edge cases
- Plan: brute force, optimize with a named pattern; complexity target
- Implement: speak out loud and keep code readable
- Validate: test tricky cases and consider follow-ups

Contest tactics
- Read all problems in 5–7 minutes; pick the easiest wins first
- Lock in points; avoid sinking time early on a hard one
- Write robust templates; copy carefully, then adapt

Speed drills (pick a few daily)
- Arrays/two pointers/sliding window: 15 minutes
- Graph BFS/DFS: 20 minutes
- DP (knapsack / string DP): 25 minutes
- Greedy/intervals: 15 minutes

Mindset
- Optimize for correctness first, then speed
- Keep hypotheses small and test quickly
- Track mistakes; turn them into checklist items
