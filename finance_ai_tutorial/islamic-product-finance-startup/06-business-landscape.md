## 6.2 Islamic Finance Market Size and Growth

### 6.2.1 Global Assets

- **Sectors**: Banking (~70%), Sukuk (~20%), Takaful (~5%), funds (~5%)

### 6.2.2 Geographic Concentration

| Region | Share | Key markets |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| GCC | ~40% | Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar |
| Southeast Asia | ~25% | Malaysia, Indonesia |
| South Asia | ~15% | Pakistan, Bangladesh |
| Others | ~20% | Turkey, Iran, Egypt, UK, others |

### 6.2.3 Trade Finance

## 6.3 Islamic Banking Business Models

### 6.3.1 Revenue Streams

| Stream | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Murabaha margin | Profit on cost-plus sales (trade, consumer, SME) |
| Ijarah income | Rent from leases |
| Musharakah/Mudarabah profit | Profit share from partnerships |
| Fee income | Wakalah, arrangement, advisory |
| Sukuk returns | Investment in Sukuk |

### 6.3.2 Cost Structure

- Funding: Deposits (Wadiah, Mudarabah), Sukuk, interbank
- Operations: Branch, IT, compliance
- Shariah: SSB fees, Shariah audit, screening

### 6.3.3 Pain Points (Opportunity for Tech)

- **Manual underwriting**: Slow, inconsistent; AI can automate and standardize
- **Shariah screening**: Fragmented; centralized API or platform can help
- **Trade finance**: Paper-intensive; digitization and product-based pricing opportunity
- **SME finance**: Underserved; product-based risk and alternative data can improve access

## 6.4 Trade Finance Dynamics

### 6.4.1 Product Types

- **Import financing**: LC, Murabaha to purchase orderer
- **Export financing**: Pre-export, post-shipment Murabaha
- **Commodity Murabaha**: Bulk commodity purchase and resale for liquidity
- **Supply chain finance**: Reverse Murabaha, factoring (with Shariah-compliant structure)

### 6.4.2 Key Players

- Islamic banks (full-service, trade-focused)
- Conventional banks with Islamic windows
- Fintechs (e.g. Wahed, StashAway Islamic, Beehive, Liwwa)
- Commodity traders and platforms

### 6.4.3 Product-Based Pricing Opportunity

- Banks often use flat or tiered margins; limited product-level granularity.
- AI can calibrate margin by product (food vs hardware), tenor, counterparty.
- Differentiator: "Product-based risk pricing" — Shariah-compliant and commercially superior.

### 6.5.2 B2B2C

- **Customers**: Islamic fintechs (neobanks, BNPL, lending apps)
- **Product**: White-label underwriting, screening
- **Pricing**: Revenue share or per-API call

## 6.6 Competitive Landscape

### 6.6.1 Incumbents

- **Core banking vendors**: Temenos, Finastra, Oracle FLEXCUBE — Islamic modules; often legacy, limited AI
- **Screening providers**: MSCI, S&P, FTSE, IdealRatings — equity screening; limited trade/SME focus
- **Consultancies**: EY, Deloitte, KPMG — advisory; not productized AI

### 6.6.2 Fintechs

- **Islamic neobanks**: Wahed, StashAway, etc. — consumer focus; some B2B opportunity
- **Trade fintechs**: Contour, Marco Polo, others — conventional focus; Islamic add-on possible
- **AI credit**: Many conventional AI credit startups; few Islamic-specific

### 6.6.3 Gap

- **Islamic + product-based + AI**: Few players; clear differentiation opportunity.
- **SSB-auditable AI**: Rare; governance-first design is a moat.

## 6.7 Go-to-Market Considerations

### 6.7.1 Entry Paths

1. **Islamic bank pilot**: Design partner; long cycle but high credibility
2. **Islamic fintech**: Faster; may need white-label
3. **Trade finance desk**: Narrow use case; prove value
4. **Regulator partnership**: Regulatory sandbox; early validation

### 6.7.2 Sales Cycle

- Islamic banks: 6–18 months (RFP, compliance, SSB, legal)
- Fintechs: 2–6 months
- Trade finance: 3–9 months

### 6.7.3 Key Success Factors

- **SSB credibility**: Scholar or SSB member as advisor/partner
- **Reference customer**: At least one live Islamic bank or fintech
- **Governance narrative**: Auditability, explainability, Shariah-first
- **Product differentiation**: "Product-based" + "Islamic" + "AI" in one platform
